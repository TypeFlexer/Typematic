# CheckCBox
CheckCBox is an extension to checked-c that guarantees spatial safety for unchecked regions of the checked-c converted code.

Checked C itself adds static and dynamic checking to C to detect or prevent common programming
errors such as buffer overruns and out-of-bounds memory accesses. 
The goal of the project is to improve systems programming by making fundamental improvements to C.
This repo contains
sample code, the [extension specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/releases),
and test code.

- For a quick overview of Checked C, more information, and pointers to example code,
  see our [Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/wiki).
- The PDF of the specification is available [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/releases).
- Compilers are available [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/releases).
- The Checked C clang repo is
  [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang).
- The instructions to build and test the Checked C compiler are documented on
  the [Checked C clang wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki).
